What's stopping you?

Are you too tired?

Didn't get enough sleep?

Don't have enouth energy?

Don't have enouth time?

Is that what's stopping you right now?

Don't have enough money?

Is that the thing?

Or is the thing that's stopping you

you?

Excuses sound best

to the person who's making them up.

Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

Get off pity potty

telling everbody you're sad
不要再向别人抱怨

and sob stories, trying to get people
不要在向别人诉苦

to show up to your pity parties
让别人参加你的同情派对

and your pity parades.
加入你的怜悯游行
